<Accordion title="Versioning" description="November 2023">
The Perplexity AI API is currently in beta release v0. Clients are not protected from backwards incompatible changes and cannot specify their desired API version. Examples of backwards incompatible changes include...
Removing support for a given model.
Renaming a response field.
Removing a response field.
Adding a required request parameter.
Backwards incompatible changes will be documented here.
Generally, the API is currently designed to be compatible with OpenAI client libraries. This means that, given the same request body, swapping the API base URL and adding your Perplexity API key will yield a response that can be parsed in the same way as the response OpenAI would yield, except for certain explicitly unsupported body parameters documented in the reference (link to reference).

# Frequently Asked Questions
Source: https://docs.perplexity.ai/faq/faq
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Why are the results from the API different from the UI? ">
1. The API uses the same search system as the UI with differences in configuration - so their outputs may differ.
2. The underlying AI model might differ between the API and the UI for a given query.
3. We give users the power to tune the API to their respective use cases using sampling parameters like `presence_penalty`, `top_p` etc and custom tuning to specific use cases might lead to less generalization of the API/different results vs the UI. We set optimized defaults and recommend not to explicitly provide sampling parameters in your API requests.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Will user data submitted through the API be used for model training or other purposes?">
We collect the following types of information:
**API Usage Data:** We collect billable usage metadata such as the number of requests and tokens. You can view your own usage in the [Perplexity API dashboard](https://perplexity.ai/settings/api).
**User Account Information:** When you create an account with us, we collect your name, email address, and other relevant contact information.
We do not retain any query data sent through the API and do not train on any of your data.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Does the API currently support web browsing?">
Yes, the [Sonar Models](https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/model-cards), leverage information from Perplexity’s search index and the public internet.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What are the limitations to the number of API calls?">
You can find our [rate limits here](https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/usage-tiers).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What's the best way to stay up to date with API updates?">
We email users about new developments and also post in the [changelog](/changelog.mdx).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How should I respond to 401: Authorization errors?">
401 error codes indicate that the provided API key is invalid, deleted or belongs to an account which ran out of credits. You likely need to purchase more credits in the [Perplexity API dashboard](https://perplexity.ai/settings/api). You can avoid this issue by configuring auto-top-up.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Do you support fine-tuning?">
Currently, we do not support fine-tuning.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="I have another question or an issue">
Please reach out to [api@perplexity.ai](mailto:api@perplexity.ai) or [support@perplexity.ai](mailto:support@perplexity.ai) for other API inquiries. You can also post on our [discussion forum](https://github.com/ppl-ai/api-discussion/discussions) and we will get back to you.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Does Perplexity provide service quality assurances such as service uptime, frequency of failures, and target recovery time in the event of a failure?">
We do not guarantee this at the moment.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Where are your DeepSeek reasoning models behind Sonar Reasoning and Sonar Reasoning Pro hosted? Is my data going to China?">
The models are hosted in the US and we do not train on any of your data. And no, your data is not going to China.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Are your reasoning APIs that use DeepSeek uncensored?">
Yes, our reasoning APIs that use DeepSeek's models are uncensored and on par with the other APIs in terms of content moderation.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Do you expose CoTs if I use your reasoning APIs or Deep Research API?">
We expose the CoTs for Sonar Reasoning Pro and Sonar Reasoning. We don't currently expose the CoTs for Deep Research.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Does R1-1776 search the web?">
R1-1776 is an offline chat model that does not search the web. So this model might not the have the most upto date information beyond its training cutoff date - which should be the same as R1.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Are the reasoning tokens in Deep Research same as CoTs in the answer?">
Reasoning tokens in Deep Research are a bit different than the CoTs in the answer - these are tokens that we use to reason through the research material prior to generating the outputs via the CoTs.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Is the internet data access provided by the API identical to that of Perplexity's web interface?">
Yes, the API offers exactly the same internet data access as Perplexity's web platform.

# Perplexity Crawlers
Source: https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/bots
We strive to improve our service every day by delivering the best search experience possible. To achieve this, we collect data using web crawlers (“robots”) and user agents that gather and index information from the internet, operating either automatically or in response to user requests. Webmasters can use the following robots.txt tags to manage how their sites and content interact with Perplexity. Each setting works independently, and it may take up to 24 hours for our systems to reflect changes.
| User Agent      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

# Integrating MCP with Perplexity's Sonar API
Source: https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/mcp-server
Learn about the MCP server implementation for the Sonar API.
## What is MCP?
The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open standard designed to connect AI assistants with the systems where data lives. By providing a universal interface for AI applications to access structured and unstructured data, MCP eliminates the need for custom integrations, enabling AI models to retrieve real-time, relevant information more efficiently. Learn more about MCP [here](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction).
## MCP Server for Perplexity's Sonar API
Our **MCP server implementation** for Sonar allows any AI-powered tool to perform real-time, web-wide research using Perplexity’s powerful search engine. This server acts as a bridge between AI applications and the Sonar, enabling seamless integration for retrieving and synthesizing relevant, up-to-date information from the web.
### How It Works
* The **Perplexity Ask MCP Server** follows MCP’s **open standard**, allowing any AI assistant or automation tool to connect to the **Sonar API** for live web searches.
* AI models can query the server for information retrieval, leveraging Perplexity’s search capabilities to return the most relevant insights.
### Example: Using MCP with Claude
Claude is one example of how this MCP server can be used effectively. When connected to Claude, the **Perplexity Ask MCP Server** enables it to **perform live web searches** and return **highly relevant, up-to-date responses**, enhancing its ability to provide real-time knowledge.
### Where to Find the Documentation
Developers looking to integrate and deploy the **Perplexity Ask MCP Server** can find our implementation, detailed documentation, and setup instructions in our official MCP repository:
📖 [**Perplexity Ask MCP Server**](https://github.com/ppl-ai/modelcontextprotocol/tree/main)
This includes:
* Implementation code
* Setup instructions
* Configuration steps
* API usage guidelines

# Pricing
Source: https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/pricing
## Overview
Perplexity AI is introducing **new pricing with search modes**, which will be available **starting today**. However, **the current (legacy) pricing remains active** and will be **deprecated on 04/18/2025**.
### **Key Changes**
* **New search modes** (`high`, `medium`, `low`) allow for greater control over search costs.
* **By default**, models will continue using **legacy pricing** unless you explicitly specify a search mode in your API call.
* **Legacy pricing will be deprecated on 04/18/2025**. Please update your integration accordingly.

# Prompt Guide
Source: https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/prompt-guide
## System Prompt
You can use the system prompt to provide instructions related to style, tone, and language of the response.
<Note>
The real-time search component of our models does not attend to the system prompt.
</Note>
**Example of a system prompt**
```
You are a helpful AI assistant.
Rules:
1. Provide only the final answer. It is important that you do not include any explanation on the steps below.
2. Do not show the intermediate steps information.
Steps:
1. Decide if the answer should be a brief sentence or a list of suggestions.
2. If it is a list of suggestions, first, write a brief and natural introduction based on the original query.
3. Followed by a list of suggestions, each suggestion should be split by two newlines.
```
## User Prompt
You should use the user prompt to pass in the actual query for which you need an answer for. The user prompt will be used to kick off a real-time web search to make sure the answer has the latest and the most relevant information needed.
**Example of a user prompt**
```
What are the best sushi restaurants in the world currently?
```
# Structured Outputs Guide
Source: https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/structured-outputs
<Note>
Structured outputs is only available to users in Tier-3
</Note>
<Info>
The first request with a new JSON Schema or Regex expects to incur delay on the first token. Typically, it takes 10 to 30 seconds to prepare the new schema, and may result in timeout errors. Once the schema has been prepared, the subsequent requests will not see such delay.
</Info>
## Overview
We currently support two types of structured outputs: **JSON Schema** and **Regex**. LLM responses will work to match the specified format, except for the following cases:
* The output exceeds `max_tokens`
Enabling the structured outputs can be done by adding a `response_format` field in the request:
**JSON Schema**
* `response_format: { type: "json_schema", json_schema: {"schema": object} }` .
* The schema should be a valid JSON schema object.
**Regex** (only available for `sonar` right now)
* `response_format: { type: "regex", regex: {"regex": str} }` .
* The regex is a regular expression string.
We recommend to give the LLM some hints about the output format in the prompts.
## Examples
### 1. Get a response in JSON format
**Request**
```python
import requests
from pydantic import BaseModel
class AnswerFormat(BaseModel):
first_name: str
last_name: str
year_of_birth: int
num_seasons_in_nba: int
url = "https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions"
headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"}
payload = {
"model": "sonar",
"messages": [
{"role": "system", "content": "Be precise and concise."},
{"role": "user", "content": (
"Tell me about Michael Jordan. "
"Please output a JSON object containing the following fields: "
"first_name, last_name, year_of_birth, num_seasons_in_nba. "
)},
],
"response_format": {
"type": "json_schema",
"json_schema": {"schema": AnswerFormat.model_json_schema()},
},
}
response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload).json()
print(response["choices"][0]["message"]["content"])
```
**Response**
```
{"first_name":"Michael","last_name":"Jordan","year_of_birth":1963,"num_seasons_in_nba":15}
```
### 2. Use a regex to output the format
**Request**
```python python
import requests
url = "https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions"
headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"}
payload = {
"model": "sonar",
"messages": [
{"role": "system", "content": "Be precise and concise."},
{"role": "user", "content": "What is the IPv4 address of OpenDNS DNS server?"},
],
"response_format": {
"type": "regex",
"regex": {"regex": r"(?:(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)\.){3}(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)"},
},
}
response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload).json()
print(response["choices"][0]["message"]["content"])
```
**Response**
```
208.67.222.222
```
## Best Practices
### Generating responses in a JSON Format
For Python users, we recommend using the Pydantic library to [generate JSON schema](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/api/base_model/#pydantic.BaseModel.model_json_schema).
**Unsupported JSON Schemas**
Recursive JSON schema is not supported. As a result of that, unconstrained objects are not supported either. Here’s a few example of unsupported schemas:
```
# UNSUPPORTED!
from typing import Any
class UnconstrainedDict(BaseModel):
unconstrained: dict[str, Any]
class RecursiveJson(BaseModel):
value: str
child: list["RecursiveJson"]
```
### Generating responses using a regex
**Supported Regex**
* Characters: `\d`, `\w`, `\s` , `.`
* Character classes: `[0-9A-Fa-f]` , `[^x]`
* Quantifiers: `*`, `?` , `+`, `{3}`, `{2,4}` , `{3,}`
* Alternation: `|`
* Group: `( ... )`
* Non-capturing group: `(?: ... )`
* Positive lookahead: `(?= ... )`
* Negative lookahead: `(?! ... )`
**Unsupported Regex**
* Contents of group: `\1`
* Anchors: `^`, `$`, `\b`
* Positive look-behind: `(?<= ... )`
* Negative look-behind: `(?<! ... )`
* Recursion: `(?R)`
