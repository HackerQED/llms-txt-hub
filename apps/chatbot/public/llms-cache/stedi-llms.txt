## Docs

- [Accounts and billing](https://stedi.com/docs/accounts-and-billing/index.md)
- [Get Execution](https://stedi.com/docs/api-reference/edi-platform/core/get-executions.md): Retrieve the file execution details for a given executionId.
- [Get Execution Input](https://stedi.com/docs/api-reference/edi-platform/core/get-executions-input.md): This endpoint retrieves an execution's input document before it passes through any translation and mappings.
- [Get Execution Metadata](https://stedi.com/docs/api-reference/edi-platform/core/get-executions-metadata.md): This endpoint retrieves an execution's metadata document.
- [Get Execution Output](https://stedi.com/docs/api-reference/edi-platform/core/get-executions-output.md): This endpoint retrieves an execution's output document.
- [Get Execution Transactions](https://stedi.com/docs/api-reference/edi-platform/core/get-executions-transactions.md): Fetch a list of transactions for a given file execution, sorted by the date they were created from newest to oldest. Includes the full transaction details.
- [List Executions](https://stedi.com/docs/api-reference/edi-platform/core/get-list-executions.md): Fetch a list of executions, sorted by the date they were created from newest to oldest.
- [List Transactions](https://stedi.com/docs/api-reference/edi-platform/core/get-list-transactions.md): Fetch a list of transactions, sorted by the date they were created from newest to oldest.
Generally this endpoint is used to display a list of transactions in a UI.
If you are looking to regularly fetch and check for new transactions for programmatic usage, you should use the `ListPollingTransactions` operation instead.
- [Poll Executions](https://stedi.com/docs/api-reference/edi-platform/core/get-pollingexecutions.md): This endpoint is used to regularly poll for new executions that have been processed by Stedi.

You must define one of `startDateTime` or `pageToken` when making a request.

You may optionally define a `pageSize`. The minimum `pageSize` is 1, and the maximum `pageSize` is 1000. The default is 100.

`startDateTime` takes a string in ISO 8601 format. (ex: `2023-08-10T18:00:00Z`). 
`startDateTime` must be set to at least 1 minute in the past.

The results will contain executions that occurred after this `startDateTime`. Starting from the oldest to newest executions ordered by the `processedAt` field. Note, this is _exclusive_ of the `startDateTime`, a execution occuring at exactly `2023-08-10T18:00:00Z` for instance, would not be included. In addition, there is a 15 second window where newly created executions will not be included to account for any network latency or clock drifts within the systems to ensure you do not miss any executions.

Each request will _always_ return a `nextPageToken`, regardless of whether there are new executions or not.

We DO NOT recommend trying to roll your own polling strategy leveraging `startDateTime` only. There are edge cases around two executions occuring at the _exact_ same time and being on the edge of a pagination which could cause you to miss one due to the exclusive nature of `startDateTime`. We recommend using `pageToken`'s instead.

When making subsequent polling requests (not initiating with `startDateTime`), the `pageToken` can be used to continue iterating through pages of executions. Usage of the `pageToken` guaruntees you will not miss any executions on the stream. If at any point there are no more new executions in the `item` array, you will still receive a `nextPageToken`. Continue to use this token to poll for new executions. Once there are new executions, they will be returned in the `item` array.

`pageToken`'s you have retrieved can serve as checkpoints. They do not expire, and you can always start from that point in the execution stream again if you need to catch a system up or recover from a failure. Storing `pageToken`'s as part of your polling process is encouraged.

`pageToken`'s are unique per request, opaque, and should not be parsed or modified in any way. They are not guaranteed to be in any particular format, and may change in the future.

- [Poll transactions](https://stedi.com/docs/api-reference/edi-platform/core/get-pollingtransactions.md): This endpoint is used to regularly poll for new transactions that have been processed in Core.

You must define one of `startDateTime` or `pageToken` when making a request.

You may optionally define a `pageSize`. The minimum `pageSize` is 1, and the maximum `pageSize` is 1000. The default is 100.

`startDateTime` takes a string in ISO 8601 format. (ex: `2023-08-10T18:00:00Z`). 
`startDateTime` must be set to at least 1 minute in the past.

Note, this is _exclusive_ of the `startDateTime`, a transaction occuring at exactly `2023-08-10T18:00:00Z` for instance, would not be included. In addition, there is a 15 second window where newly created transactions will not be included to account for any network latency or clock drifts within the systems to ensure you do not miss any transactions.
