## What is backfilling a job board?
Backfilling a job board involves augmenting its own job listings with external postings from various sources. This integration allows job boards to present a broader array of opportunities to their users, helping to attract more traffic, boost user engagement, and ultimately enhance their overall value proposition.
## Why TheirStack is the best job board backfill solution
Backfilling job boards is a common use case for our Job data platform and it was built with this in mind:
-  **Original job link to company website** When a job originates from a company's career page, we include the URL (`final_url`) so you can redirect users to the correct source. You can also get only jobs from career pages with the `final_url_exists` filter.
-   **Standardized job descriptions** Our job descriptions are standardized across all information sources in Markdown format, ensuring consistency.
-   **Company information** Most of our jobs are enriched with company information, so can use the company `domain`, `industry`, `headcount`, `revenue`, `type`, `location` and technologies used for your company profile page.
-   **Up-to-date data** The data is up-to-date, with new jobs being added to our database every minute.
-   **Filters** If you are a niche job board, you can use the `job_title_or` filter to get specific jobs, or the company `industry_id_or` filter to get only jobs from companies in a specific industry or any of our 20+ filters.
- **16k+ job data sources** so you can get a wide range of jobs from all over the world. [Learn more](/en/docs/job-sources)
## How to backfill a job board
You have two options:
1. **Webhook (Recommended)**: Set up a webhook to listen for the `new.job` event. By applying the necessary filters, you can ensure that you only receive the job postings that meet your specific criteria. This approach allows you to automatically receive new job listings as soon as they are published.
- Step 1 - Create a job search with your desired criteria (e.g: location, company, technology, etc). You can create as many as you want.  It's important to create exclusive criteria to avoid receiving duplicate job postings.
- Step 2 - Set up a webhook to listen for the `new.job` event. [How to set up a webhook](/en/docs/webhooks)
2. **API**: Use our [Jobs API](https://api.theirstack.com) to fetch jobs periodically. Check out our [Fetch jobs periodically](/en/docs/fetch-periodically-jobs) guide for more details.
The API approach is more cumbersome as it involves some extra steps from you, so our recommendation is to use webhooks.

title: How are you positioning against Builwith?
description:
lastModifiedAt: 2025-01-03
url: https://theirstack.com/en/docs/differences-with-builtwith
---
Our approach to sourcing tech usage data sets us apart from BuiltWith in a few key ways. First, we offer a broader technology catalog that includes not only web technologies but also CRMs, ERPs, databases, and various internal tools. BuiltWith focuses solely on web technologies.
Additionally, instead of tracking websites, we gather data from job postings. Each month, we collect job listings from millions of companies by monitoring company websites, job boards, and other hiring platforms. When a job listing mentions a specific technology in the title or description, it indicates that the company likely uses that technology. We then assign a Confidence Score (low, medium, high) based on the frequency and context of these mentions to estimate how likely the company is to use that technology.
Our pricing model is also unique. While BuiltWith charges based on technology reports, we base our pricing on the number of companies returned in your search.

lastModifiedAt: 2025-01-16
url: https://theirstack.com/en/docs/does-theirstack-provide-contact-data
---
We have direct integrations with top-tier third-party contact data providers such as Apollo.io, ContactOut, and LinkedIn ([see this guide for more information](/en/docs/finding-contact-data)).
Additionally, we offer hiring manager information for applicable jobs, including the recruiter's name, position, and LinkedIn profile.
However, we do not supply contact data directly for several reasons:
-   Rather than attempting to cover multiple areas, we focus on excelling in one‚Äîhelping you identify companies with strong purchasing intent. As a small company, we must choose our priorities wisely.
-   Collecting and distributing personal contact data may not comply with GDPR regulations, despite being a common practice among many contact data providers.

title: How to fetch periodically jobs using Jobs API
description: This guide will demonstrate how to periodically fetch jobs from the TheirStack API, ensuring fresh data and minimizing API costs.

import { Alert, AlertDescription, AlertTitle } from '@/shared/ui/base/alert'
import { TriangleAlert } from 'lucide-react'
<Alert variant="warning">
<TriangleAlert className="h-4 w-4" />
<AlertTitle>Important notice</AlertTitle>
<AlertDescription>
We strongly recommend using our [webhooks](/docs/webhooks) to fetch jobs periodically. Using the Jobs API will make it harder to ensure fresh data and minimize API costs.
</AlertDescription>
</Alert>
To integrate TheirStack's job data seamlessly into your application or database, focus on the following:
-   [Ensure fresh data with efficient batching](#ensure-fresh-data-with-efficient-batching).
-   [Minimize API costs by optimizing your requests](#minimize-api-costs-by-optimizing-your-requests).
-   [Avoid missing any data during the integration process](#avoid-missing-any-data-during-the-integration-process).
### Ensure fresh data with efficient batching
We continuously monitor company websites and job boards to identify new job postings. To optimize performance, we recommend batching your requests with a maximum frequency of once every hour or two hours, based on your needs, and using the maximum limit of 500 jobs per page.
### Minimize API costs by optimizing your requests
One API Credit is consumed for each record returned from our API endpoints. If you fetch the same job multiple times, you will be charged for each fetch.
The `discovered_at` field in the `job` object indicates the date and time when the job was first identified by TheirStack. To prevent duplicate charges when fetching jobs, you can filter by `discovered_at_gte` in your request to get only new jobs. This parameter will ensure that only jobs discovered after the specified date are fetched.
The `discovered_at_gte` parameter is a timestamp in the format `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ` and it should be the date and time of the last job you fetched.
```sql
SELECT MAX(discovered_at) FROM jobs;
```
Copy the timestamp and use it as the value for `discovered_at_gte` in your request.
```bash
curl --request POST \
--url "https://api.theirstack.com/v1/jobs/search" \
--header "Accept: application/json" \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--header "Authorization: Bearer <api_key>" \
-d '{
"offset": 0,
"limit": 500,
"discovered_at_gte": "2024-12-29T17:32:28Z"
"job_title_or": [
"Data Engineer"
],
"posted_at_max_age_days": 15,
"job_country_code_or": [
"NG"
],
}'
```
Another option is to use the `job_id_not` filter. You'd need to fetch the IDs of the jobs you already have in your system from us, and pass them to the Job Search Endpoint. This can be useful if you fetch jobs from multiple searches and the same job may appear in the results from more than one search.
### Avoid missing any data during the integration process
If your cron process fails‚Äîwhether due to system downtime, credit depletion, or connection issues‚Äîyou can resume from the last processed job using the `discovered_at_gte` parameter. This ensures you fetch only the jobs discovered after the last successful run, preventing any data loss even in periodic integrations.

## Why can't I see a company that was previously unblurred?
When you reveal a company, a company credit is used. This allows you to view all their jobs, technologies, and firmographics, or export that company as many times as you want for 90 days.
Since collecting new jobs or technologies incurs a cost, it's not feasible to offer unlimited access to new data indefinitely.
However, we are planning an enhancement to offer you a better experience: after 90 days, you will still be able to see the company, but any new jobs or technologies discovered after that period will not be accessible. This ensures you retain the data you've paid for, without receiving updates beyond the initial access period.

Are you a sales intelligence platform like Clay, Databar, or Trigify? We've compiled everything you need to seamlessly integrate TheirStack as a source of job data and technographics into your product. This is a dynamic, evolving guide that improves with each integration. Your feedback and suggestions are always welcome!
## Introduction
At TheirStack, we are passionate about building long-term partnerships with sales intelligence platforms. Our goal is to become the largest, most reliable, and fastest-responding job and technographics database. Everything we do is driven by this vision. If you're seeking top-quality job and technographic data, we‚Äôre the ideal partner for you.
### How API credits work
API credits are used to make API requests. One API Credit is consumed for each record (job or company) returned from our API endpoints.
How API credits work:
-   Credits are only consumed when the API returns data in the response.
-   Each API call is processed independently - repeated requests for the same data will consume credits each time.
-   Unused paid credits will roll over and accumulate in your account.
#### Free records count
Get the count of records that match your search criteria is free. This is useful to show a preview to your end users.
#### Preview mode
Our Job Search and Company Search endpoints include a preview mode that does not consume credits. Use this mode to display a preview for your end users by using the `blur_company_data` field.

## Quick Decision Guide
**Choose BrightData if**
-   You don't need a real-time solution and are fine waiting 4-5 minutes for each job search.
-   You're comfortable implementing a complex integration with multiple API calls, retry logic, and snapshot storage.
-   You don't need extensive filtering capabilities
-   You‚Äôre prepared to manage separate processes for each job board and handle job deduplication yourself.
**Choose TheirStack if**
-   You need a real-time solution that responds in 100ms-2s
-   You want a fast and easy integration with a single API call
-   You want to filter by attributes like company countries, industries, company sizes, job description, etc
-   You want all the jobs from all the job boards in one place and don't want to handle job deduplication.
## Detailed comparison
BrightData is a general purpose web data extraction platform, so jobs per se are not their main focus. On the other hand, jobs is at the core of what we do at TheirStack. So 100% of our effort is in building a high-quality, end-to-end job data platform.
### Development cost and complexity
BrightData's integration is complex:
-   It requires at least two API calls for each search: one to create the search and another to retrieve the results.
-   You'll need to save in your database the snapshot ID of each search so that you can retrieve the results later.
-   You'll need to implement retry logic since the data isn't immediately available and can take several minutes to be ready.
-   There is no pagination so you will likely miss some jobs
-   If you need to search in multiple job boards,
-   you'll need separate API calls for each source
-   you'll need to handle job deduplication on your side because job boards share most of their jobs.
TheirStack integration is straightforward with just a single API call needed. You can find our complete documentation [here](https://api.theirstack.com/#tag/jobs/POST/v1/jobs/search).
### Response time
When you make a request to TheirStack, we make a search in our database, which already contains millions of jobs scraped from [thousands of job boards and websites](/en/docs/job-sources). The response comes back almost instantly - 90% of our requests finish in less than 2 seconds.
For example, to get the last data analyst jobs posted in NYC in the last 7 days with us you'd make this call:
```bash
curl --request POST \
--url "https://api.theirstack.com/v1/jobs/search" \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--header "Authorization: Bearer <api_key>" \
--data '{
"posted_at_max_age_days": 7,
"job_country_code_or": [
"US"
],
"job_title_or": [
"data analyst"
],
"job_location_pattern_or": [
"new york",
"nyc"
]
}'
```
In BrightData, when you make a search they do a live call to their job boards to get the data. This process involves 2 calls and the results not only aren't instant but take **minutes** to come back.
To get the same data as in the previous example, first you'd make a call like this:
```bash
curl --request POST \
--url "https://api.brightdata.com/datasets/v3/trigger?dataset_id=gd_lpfll7v5hcqtkxl6l&include_errors=true&type=discover_new&discover_by=keyword&limit_per_input=5" \
--header "Authorization: Bearer <bearer_token>" \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data '[
{
"location": "New York",
"keyword": "data analyst",
"country": "US",
"time_range": "Past week",
"job_type": "",
"experience_level": "",
"remote": "",
"company": ""
}
]'
```
The result of this would not be the data directly, but a snapshot ID like this:
```json
{
"snapshot_id": "s_m5o15lt05g12b9s1x"
}
```
You'd then need to make a second call to get the data:
```bash
curl --request GET \
--url "https://api.brightdata.com/datasets/v3/snapshot/s_m5o15lt0rn12b9s1x?format=json" \
--header "Authorization: Bearer <bearer_token>"
```
From our tests, this requests takes 8-10s to complete, and even after 3 or 4 minutes, the data isn't ready yet and we'd get responses like this:
```json
{
"status": "running",
"message": "Snapshot is not ready yet, try again in 10s"
}
```
This invalidates using BrightData for any real-time use case you might have related to jobs. But not only that.
### Extensive filtering capabilities
BrightData just lets you filter by the limited set of filters LinkedIn supports.
TheirStack lets you filter by many filters that LinkedIn or BrightData don't support and won't support anytime soon. To name a few:
-   **Company filters:** By industry, size, country, revenue, funding, URL, LinkedIn URL or slug, etc.
-   **Job filters:** By title, description, country, city, remote options, salary, etc. Regular expression filters are supported by many fields like title, description or locations
### Historical data
BrightData only provides access to recent job postings, with limited historical data availability.
TheirStack maintains a comprehensive historical database of jobs dating back to 2019, allowing you to access and analyze job postings across much larger time spans.
### Comprehensive documentation.
BrightData's job scraping API documentation is limited and requires frequent communication with support to understand parameter usage and functionality.
We are an API-first company, so our [Job Search API](https://api.theirstack.com/#tag/jobs/POST/v1/jobs/search) is at the core of what we do and we talk with users daily to make it better and add new filters and features they need. We put great care into the developer experience, and you can tell so by visiting the link above and seeing how well documented our API is, so that you don't have to waste time figuring out how each parameter works or talking to support to get help.
### Job consolidation across multiple job boards
BrightData offers LinkedIn, Indeed and Glassdoor job scrapers. We scrape those and more job boards, having jobs from tens of thousands of domains.
With BrightData you would need to use one individual scraper per each job board, and then consolidate jobs into a central repository.
With TheirStack, we consolidate jobs from all of them into a single database and provide a single API endpoint to access them so that you can get all the jobs you want with a single request, instead of having to make multiple requests to different scrapers.
### Job deduplication
Because BrightData has different endpoints for each job board, they don't handle job deduplication across them. But it happens many times that the same job appears on multiple job boards.
As we offer a single entrypoint for all our job data, we have built our own job deduplication algorithm that lets us identify if the same job has already been scraped. Therefore, you won't get the same job twice and you won't have to worry about handling job deduplication yourself.

description: Learn how to use webhooks to get notified when events occur (new jobs, tech changes, etc) in TheirStack and trigger actions in your external systems like N8N, Zapier, Make, Airtable, etc.

## What are webhooks?
Webhooks allow you to send data when specific events occur (new jobs, tech changes, etc) to external systems like N8N, Zapier, Make, Airtable, your own webhook endpoint, etc.
For instance, you can configure a webhook to alert you when a new job is listed in a particular location, company, or technology sector.
Webhooks are dependent on a search, which defines the criteria for triggering the webhook.
There are two types of webhooks:
- **`job.new`**: Triggered when a new job is discovered by TheirsStack.
- **`company.new`**: Triggered when a new company is discovered by TheirsStack.
## How to set up a webhook
Follow these steps to set up a webhook:
1. Create a job or company search with the criteria you are interested in.
2. Click on the "Webhooks" button on the search page.
3. Click on the "Create Webhook" button.
4. Enter the webhook URL and click on the "Create" button.
<YoutubeIframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gbd8IMgL-Rw" title="Webhooks" />
## Webhooks Applications
- Initiate a workflow in an automation tool like Zapier, Make, N8N when a new job is posted or a company adopts a new technology (e.g., Snowflake, Hubspot, Python).
- Send a Slack notification to your team when a new job is found or a company adopts a new technology (e.g., Snowflake, Hubspot, Python).
- Automatically update a Google Sheet with new job or company data.
- Trigger an email alert to a specific distribution list when a new job matches certain criteria.
- Create a table in Airtable to store job listings.
- Integrate with a CRM system to add new company information as leads.
## Your own webhook endpoint
If you are builing your own webhook endpoint, please take into account the following:
- Return a 200 status code to indicate that the webhook event was received and processed successfully. Failed webhook events are retried every hour for 48 hours.
- Your webhook endpoint has to be prepared to handle at least 2 concurrent requests.
- Your webhook endpoint has to be prepared to handle duplicates. Our system is designed to not send the same job twice to your webhook URL. However, this could happen in some edge cases (e.g: you listen to two searches with not exclusive jobs).
- When a webhook sends data, it uses an HTTP POST request, with a JSON payload.
per
## Faqs
### What happens to webhook events when I run out of API credits?
When you run out of API credits, webhook event monitoring is temporarily paused. During this period, no new events will appear in your webhook history. Monitoring automatically resumes once you purchase additional API credits.
Whether you miss events during the pause depends on your search criteria. For example, if your webhook tracks jobs posted within the last 60 days and you lack credits for 2 days, you won't miss anything - when credits are restored, all jobs discovered during the pause will still trigger your webhook as they match your search parameters.
### What happens if the webhook event fails?
If the webhook event fails, it will be automatically retried every hour for 48 hours.
### How much cost to run a webhook?
Webhook events are billed at the same rate as API requests. They consume 1 API credit per event.

title: Why do I see a smaller number of job listings on TheirStack compared to platforms like Indeed or LinkedIn?
description: When you search for a job on Indeed or Linkedin, you may see more results than on TheirStack. This is because Indeed uses broader keyword matching, while TheirStack prioritizes precision.
lastModifiedAt: '2024-12-31'
url: https://theirstack.com/en/docs/why-do-i-see-less-jobs-on-theirstack-than-indeed
---
The difference lies in how job searches are conducted on TheirStack versus platforms like LinkedIn, Indeed, or Glassdoor. Let's focus on Indeed as an example, though the same principles apply to other providers.
## Search methodology
### Keyword matching
Job boards like Indeed use broader keyword matching:
- **Synonyms and Related Jobs**: For example, when you search for "network engineer," Indeed may return jobs that loosely match those terms, even if they don't contain the exact keywords.
- **Company Name Matching**: For example, when you search for "franchise", LinkedIn may return jobs where the company name contains the word 'franchise'.
On TheirStack, we prioritize precision. Our job title filter is deterministic, meaning it only returns results with an exact match for the keywords you provide. This approach ensures greater accuracy in the search results.

### Date range
Indeed and LinkedIn typically display jobs that have been posted or reposted within the last 30 days by default, whereas TheirStack does not automatically filter jobs based on their reposted date.
## How to Increase Results on TheirStack
-   **Add More Keywords**: Broaden your search terms to include additional relevant keywords (see Picture A).

## Upcoming Features
We're working on
- a new filter that incorporates a synonym dictionary, which will enhance your search capabilities.
- a new filter that allows you to filter by reposted date.
## Avoid Filtering by Scraping Source
We scrape jobs from various sources, including company career pages, LinkedIn, and job boards. To avoid duplication, we save only the first instance of a job posting. For example, if a job appears on a company's career page and on Indeed, only the first source is stored.
Filtering by `scraping_source = Indeed` will return only jobs initially found on Indeed, which may reduce the results. We recommend using broader filters for a more comprehensive search.

### Introduction
When analyzing our data, you'll notice that a small percentage of jobs are discovered (`discovered_at`) after the day when they were initially posted (`posted_at`). This delay is common and is influenced by various factors beyond our control.
### Discovery Timeline
To illustrate this, let's examine jobs posted on a specific day (December 14th) and observe when they were discovered by us.

</div>
| Discovered At | Percentage of Jobs Discovered |
| ------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Same Day (0)  | 73%                           |
| Next Day (1)  | 21%                           |
| 2 Days Later  | 3%                            |
| 3 Days Later  | 0.3%                          |
| 4 Days Later  | 0.2%                          |
As shown, 73% of jobs are found on the same day they are posted. However, there is a significant number of jobs discovered days later. To understand this, it's important to know how we collect our data.
### Factors Contributing to Delays
We scrape job boards, that at the same time scrape other job boards and career pages of companies. They also can get jobs posted directly by companies, or from companies‚Äô ATS systems that sync with these job boards.
While we scrape these job boards constantly, there are many reasons a job posted by a company at a certain date is not available on those job boards instantly, and therefore it‚Äôs not possible for us to discover it. To name a few:
-   **ATSs sync delay with job boards**: The ATS that a company uses lets them sync jobs with a major job board, but the recruiter can choose which jobs to push to that job board because they charge for it. They may not initially sync it and do it after a few days to try to get more candidates. But the integration may keep the original date when the job was posted first, and show that in the final job board, instead of the date when the job was pushed. In this case, there will be a gap of a few days.
-   **Job board scrapping delay**: A job board scrapes company career pages periodically, running daily. If a company posts a job at 14h and the job board scraper visits it at 10h every day, that job won‚Äôt be available in the job board until the day after. For companies that post many positions, it makes sense for job boards to visit those career pages with a high frequency. But visiting every career page of every company in the world periodically has a cost, so for smaller companies that very ocasionally post jobs, doing it on a weekly basis could help those job boards save money. So imagine they visit one of these companies‚Äô career site every Monday. If they post a job on Tuesday, they won‚Äôt visit it again until next Monday, so there will be a 6-day difference between `posted_at` and `discovered_at`
-   **Job board publishing delay**: If someone publishes a job directly on a job board we scrape, this job board may also let them set a custom `posted_at` that is days before the current date. But the job is not available at that job board until the very moment when that person publishes it there, and even if the reported `posted_at` is previous to that, that job wouldn‚Äôt have been discovered before because that person hadn‚Äôt published it in that job board yet.
